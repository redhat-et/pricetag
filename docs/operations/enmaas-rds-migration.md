# EnMaaS RDS migration runbook

This runbook records the staged migration of the isolated EnMaaS PriceTag
database from CloudNativePG to AWS RDS. It is not a production runbook.

## Current target

- AWS account: `624013087577`
- Region: `us-west-2`
- RDS instance: `enmaas-db`
- Database: `aigateway`
- Application roles: `aigateway`, `metering_reader`
- Application connection Secrets: `maas-db-config`,
  `postgresql-credentials`, and `metering-readonly-db-url`

## Staged cutover sequence

1. Verify CNPG health, successful backup/archiving, and zero duplicate
   `usage_events.event_id` values.
2. Verify RDS, security groups, TLS, backup retention, and restore policy. Do
   not use the RDS administrative user for applications.
3. Create the target database and least-privilege roles.
4. Perform an initial snapshot-consistent dump/restore while applications stay
   live.
5. Validate table counts, event-ID uniqueness, API-key count, pricing rows,
   rollups, and representative read-only queries.
6. During a controlled maintenance window, stop `praxis`, `maas-api`, and
   `metering-service`; wait for usage-event delivery to drain.
7. Repeat the dump/restore from the frozen CNPG source. Exclude only obsolete
   backup artifacts; never exclude application tables.
8. Update all three application connection Secrets together:
   - `maas-db-config/DB_CONNECTION_URL`;
   - `postgresql-credentials/MAAS_DB_URL` and `METERING_DB_URL`;
   - `metering-readonly-db-url/READ_DATABASE_URL`.
9. Start MaaS API, metering, and Praxis; wait for readiness and verify new RDS
   connections.
10. Run API-key validation, entitlement, GLM, Anthropic/Vertex, OpenAI, and
    dashboard smoke tests. Confirm a new usage event lands in RDS.
11. Keep CNPG and rollback material available through an observation window.
12. Only after backup/restore, idempotency, performance, and rollback gates
    pass may CNPG be decommissioned.

## Rollback

Stop application writers, restore the pre-RDS connection Secret values,
restart MaaS API and metering, restore Praxis if needed, and verify that new
connections return to CNPG. Do not delete CNPG or its storage as part of the
initial migration.

## Required gates before decommissioning CNPG

## Capacity baseline — 2026-09-29

The following benchmark exercised the metering entitlement GET path through
the two-replica metering service using synthetic identities. It performed
read-only checks only; it did not call a provider or create usage events.

| Concurrent checks | Requests | Success | p50 | p95 | p99 | Max |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 | 752 | 752 | 146 ms | 495 ms | 524 ms | 525 ms |
| 100 | 1,309 | 1,309 | 195 ms | 587 ms | 625 ms | 679 ms |
| 250 | 2,971 | 2,971 | 326 ms | 632 ms | 671 ms | 727 ms |

RDS CloudWatch observations after the benchmark were approximately:

- CPU average 2%; peak below 3%;
- maximum connections 19;
- DB load maximum 1;
- read latency 0 seconds; write latency approximately 7 ms.

The post-test GLM inference, model discovery, dashboard health/readiness, and
RDS ledger checks all passed. This is a bounded baseline, not a 700-user SLO:
the next test should use sustained traffic, realistic request rates, and
application pool-wait metrics.

- RDS automated backup and point-in-time restore verified.
- RDS security groups no longer permit unnecessary public exposure.
- Unique `usage_events(event_id)` constraint installed after duplicate-safe
  application ingestion is deployed.
- RDS p95 entitlement and event-ingestion latency meet the agreed SLO.
- Two-replica metering behavior has no rollup/parity errors.
- A bounded read-only burst has been measured, but sustained 700-user traffic
  remains a separate load-test gate.
- Full rollback has been rehearsed or explicitly accepted by the owner.
