# EnMaaS Metering-only rolling update

Use this runbook to deploy a merged `redhat-et/pricetag-metering` commit
without changing Praxis, MaaS API, Routes, TLS, or NetworkPolicies.

This is the preferred path for a Metering-only change. Do not run the full
`deploy.sh` apply unless its rendered diff has been reviewed. A full apply can
also reconcile the Praxis ConfigMap and roll the gateway.

## 1. Confirm the target

Use the dedicated EnMaaS kubeconfig and verify the current workload state:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/secure/path/enmaas-kubeconfig
oc whoami --show-server
oc -n enmaas get deployment maas-api metering-service praxis
oc -n enmaas get deployment/metering-service \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable}/{.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge}{"\n"}'
```

The expected Metering state is `4/4` ready replicas and rolling strategy
`0/1`. Stop if the cluster is not healthy before the update.

Run the read-only live validator before changing the image:

```bash
export EXPECTED_OC_SERVER='https://api.<enmaas-cluster>:443'
export PROTECTED_OC_SERVER='https://api.<protected-cluster>:<port>'
export PRICETAG_KUBECONFIG="$KUBECONFIG"
./tools/validate-live-enmaas.sh
```

## 2. Validate the merged source

Use a full commit SHA from `redhat-et/pricetag-metering` main. Do not build
from a local-only or unpushed commit.

```bash
export METERING_SOURCE_SHA='<40-character-merged-commit-sha>'
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/pricetag-metering.git /tmp/pricetag-metering
cd /tmp/pricetag-metering
git checkout "$METERING_SOURCE_SHA"
go test ./...
go vet ./...
git diff --check
```

## 3. Build an immutable AMD64 image

The EnMaaS nodes require an AMD64 image. The cluster builder may fail when it
cannot reach public registries, so the proven fallback is a local Podman build.

```bash
export IMAGE_TAG="practice-metering-${METERING_SOURCE_SHA:0:8}"
podman build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t "localhost/enmaas/metering-service:${IMAGE_TAG}" .
```

## 4. Push to the internal registry

For a macOS Podman machine, forward the OpenShift registry and push from inside
the Podman VM. The VM host address is environment-specific; verify it with
`podman machine ssh 'ip route'` before use.

```bash
export REGISTRY_HOST=192.168.127.254:5001
oc --address=0.0.0.0 -n openshift-image-registry \
  port-forward svc/image-registry 5001:5000
```

In another terminal:

```bash
oc whoami -t | podman machine ssh podman login \
  --tls-verify=false \
  --username="$(oc whoami)" \
  --password-stdin "$REGISTRY_HOST"

podman tag "localhost/enmaas/metering-service:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  "$REGISTRY_HOST/enmaas/metering-service:${IMAGE_TAG}"

podman machine ssh podman push --tls-verify=false \
  "$REGISTRY_HOST/enmaas/metering-service:${IMAGE_TAG}"
```

Record the immutable digest returned by the cluster:

```bash
export METERING_IMAGE_DIGEST="$(oc -n enmaas get istag \
  "metering-service:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  -o jsonpath='{.image.dockerImageReference}' | sed 's/.*@//')"
printf '%s\n' "$METERING_IMAGE_DIGEST"
```

Do not deploy a mutable `latest` tag.

## 5. Roll out Metering only

Save the current Deployment for rollback, verify the rolling strategy, and
change only the Metering image:

```bash
export PREVIOUS_IMAGE="$(oc -n enmaas get deployment/metering-service \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}')"
test -n "$PREVIOUS_IMAGE"
printf 'Previous image: %s\n' "$PREVIOUS_IMAGE"
printf '%s\n' "$PREVIOUS_IMAGE" \
  > "metering-service-previous-image-${IMAGE_TAG}.txt"

oc -n enmaas get deployment/metering-service -o yaml \
  > "metering-service-before-${IMAGE_TAG}.yaml"

test "$(oc -n enmaas get deployment/metering-service \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable}/{.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge}')" = "0/1"

oc -n enmaas set image deployment/metering-service \
  "metering-service=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/enmaas/metering-service@${METERING_IMAGE_DIGEST}"

oc -n enmaas rollout status deployment/metering-service --timeout=10m
oc -n enmaas get deployment/metering-service
```

This starts the database migration in the new pods while the old pods remain
serving. Do not restart Praxis or MaaS for a Metering-only change.

### Startup and migration lock watch

This rollout has an existing Metering startup risk that is not visible from
`rollout status` alone. Every Metering pod runs database migrations at startup
under a shared PostgreSQL advisory lock with a 10-second context. If several
new pods start together, one can hold the lock while another waits past the
timeout and crash-loops. Pricing initialization has taken approximately
45–50 seconds in the test environment; larger production data can increase
the startup and lock-wait risk.

During and after the rollout:

1. Watch both readiness and each pod's restart count. A successful rollout
   status is not sufficient if a pod has recently restarted.
2. Wait until every replica is Ready and no new restarts occur for several
   minutes before declaring success.
3. Check recent Metering logs and events for migration failures, advisory-lock
   timeouts, crash loops, or readiness failures. Do not copy credentials,
   connection strings, or tokens from logs into deployment evidence.
4. Confirm Metering endpoints are healthy, the advisory-lock queue is clear
   through the approved database observability path, and `usage_events`
   ingestion continues.
5. If a new pod repeatedly fails migration or readiness, stop treating the
   rollout as healthy and restore the saved image digest using the rollback
   procedure below. Keep the old Ready replicas serving while investigating.

## 6. Validate after rollout

Check all pods and recent logs:

```bash
oc -n enmaas get deployment maas-api metering-service praxis
oc -n enmaas get pods -l app=metering-service
oc -n enmaas logs -l app=metering-service --since=10m \
  | grep -Ei 'error|fatal|panic|migration' || true
```

Run the read-only smoke and authentication checks:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH \
  ./tools/functional-test.sh --target enmaas --level smoke
PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH \
  ./tools/functional-test.sh --target enmaas --level auth
```

The authentication test can report catalog expectation failures that are
unrelated to a Metering-only image. Record them separately. Use a valid Partner
API token to verify the authenticated user API when needed; never put tokens in
command arguments or logs.

Inference validation is optional and consumes tokens. Run it only after explicit
approval:

```bash
MODEL_FREE='rits/zai-org/glm-5-3' \
MODEL_OPENAI='gpt-5.6-luna' \
  PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH \
  ./tools/functional-test.sh --target enmaas --level inference --confirm-prod
```

## 7. Rollback

If readiness, API health, or error rates regress, restore the previous recorded
image. This does not change Praxis or MaaS. Use the same shell's
`PREVIOUS_IMAGE`, or load the saved value in a new shell:

```bash
export PREVIOUS_IMAGE="$(cat "metering-service-previous-image-${IMAGE_TAG}.txt")"
test -n "$PREVIOUS_IMAGE"
oc -n enmaas set image deployment/metering-service \
  "metering-service=${PREVIOUS_IMAGE}"
oc -n enmaas rollout status deployment/metering-service --timeout=10m
```

Record the source SHA, image digest, previous digest, rollout time, validation
results, and any warnings in the deployment evidence.
